Reads a text file consisting of people's names and phone numbers and creates an Account class object for each person with matching first and last names,
phone number, and assigns them a randomly generated balance to their account, Account ID, username & password login, and gender.
All accounts are stored in an ArrayList, i.e Dynamic Array, and is then sorted by first name.
Upon running the program, one is able to search up an Account by first or last name or specifc index and access it or add a new account.
When accessing a specifc account, you can change their first or last names, phone numbers, login info, account balance, and gender.
All changes made to an account will be saved when returning to the programs main menu, but upon closing the program all changes will be lost.
